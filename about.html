<br><br><h3>About the Snake</h3></p><br>
I'm Collie, I'm 16, I live in Austria and I love experimenting with all kinds things <br>
(including names 'cause damn sure nobody in their right mind actually named their child Snake)<br><br>
Mainly webdesign though and as you might have guessed, this website is my main project<br>
I also have some other projects going on (some more successful than others) and some of which can also be found around here<br><br>
So if you'd like feel free to check out my whole page and also give feedback if you have some<br><br>
***Note: this Website was built without any templates and is still a work in progress and it's still pretty far from perfect,<br>
so please don't judge me too hard***<br><br><br>
You can find me at my social-medias linked below (the facebook link doesn't work yet)<br><br><br>
